# Digital VLSI SoC Design & Planning

Summary of the lecture on **Digital VLSI SoC (System-on-Chip) Design and Planning**. It outlines the complete journey of transforming a C application into a fabricated chip, highlighting key stages, design checks, and important terminology.

---

## 1. Design Objective

The ultimate goal is to implement a **specific application** on a chip by designing a custom processor and integrating all required peripherals into a single System-on-Chip.

---

## 2. End-to-End Flow

The design process is organized into progressive stages, with functional equivalence checks at every step.

### **Stage O0**

* Start with the target C application.
* Compile using **GCC**.

### **Stage O1**

* Compile the same application with it's specs.
* Compare outputs of O0 and O1 to ensure functional equivalence. Only proceed if they match.

### **Stage O2**

* Convert the application specification into **RTL (Register Transfer Level)** code, typically in **Verilog/SystemVerilog**.
* Simulate and verify that RTL outputs match the O1 software outputs.
* If verified, this RTL becomes the *soft copy* of the hardware design.

### **Stage O3 — SoC Architecture & Integration**

* **Partition the design** into two major subsystems:

  * **Processor Core** – Must be *synthesizable*; produce a **gate-level netlist** during synthesis.
  * **Peripherals** – Divide into:

    * **Digital Macros** (reusable IP blocks like SRAM or I/O controllers).
    * **Analog IP** (e.g., ADCs, PLLs) for mixed-signal requirements.
* Integrate processor, peripherals, and I/O interfaces (e.g., **GPIOs**) into a cohesive SoC.

## 3. Physical Design Flow

After successful SoC integration, the physical implementation begins:

* **Floorplanning** – Organize soft logic and place hard macros.
* **Place & Route** – Automatic placement of standard cells and routing of interconnections.
* **Clock Tree Synthesis** – Distribute clock signals while controlling skew.
* **DRC/LVS Checks** – Ensure design rule compliance and layout-versus-schematic consistency.
* **GDSII Generation** – Produce final layout data for fabrication.
* **Tape-Out** – Send the GDSII file to the semiconductor foundry for chip manufacturing.

## 4. Key Definitions

| Term                  | Description                                                       |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Soft Logic**        | Synthesizable RTL that can be transformed into gates.             |
| **Hard Macro**        | Pre-designed, fixed-layout block (e.g., SRAM, analog IP).         |
| **Equivalence Check** | Verifying that two design stages exhibit identical functionality. |

## 5. Microprocessor vs. Microcontroller

The professor distinguished these two categories:

* **Microprocessor** – A CPU core requiring external peripherals and memory. *Examples: Intel 8085, 8086.*
* **Microcontroller** – A full SoC integrating CPU, memory, and peripherals. *Example: ATmega51.*

**In summary**, the lecture presents a disciplined flow from C application to manufactured chip, emphasizing continuous verification, careful partitioning of processor and peripherals, and robust physical design practices leading to a successful tape-out.
